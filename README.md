### Bootstrapping a new project

1. Clone the master branch of this repository with

   ```
   $ git clone --single-branch git@github.com:meltwater/makenew-node-lib.git <new-node-lib>
   $ cd <new-node-lib>
   ```

   Optionally, reset to the latest version with

   ```
   $ git reset --hard <version-tag>
   ```

2. Create an empty (non-initialized) repository on GitHub.

3. Create a new [CircleCI] project.
   Add `NPM_TOKEN` as an environment variable.
   Create a project API token with status scope
   to use for the README build badge.

4. Optionally setup [Codecov].
   Navigate to the settings page for the Codecov project,
   use the Upload Token to add `CODECOV_TOKEN`
   as an environment variable to the CircleCI project,
   and note the Graphing Token to use for the README badge.

5. Run

   ```
   $ ./makenew.sh
   ```

   This will replace the boilerplate, delete itself,
   remove the git remote, remove upstream tags,
   and stage changes for commit.

6. Add and commit the changes and push to GitHub with

   ```
   $ git add .
   $ git commit -m "Replace makenew boilerplate"
   $ git remote add origin git@github.com:meltwater/<new-node-lib>.git
   $ git push -u origin master
   ```

7. Ensure the CircleCI build passes,
   then publish the initial version of the package with

   ```
   $ nvm install
   $ yarn
   $ npm version patch
   ```

8. Update the branch protection options for `master`
   to require all status checks to pass.

### Updating from this skeleton

If you want to pull in future updates from this skeleton,
you can fetch and merge in changes from this repository.

Add this as a new remote with

```
$ git remote add upstream git@github.com:meltwater/makenew-node-lib.git
```

You can then fetch and merge changes with

```
$ git fetch --no-tags upstream
$ git merge upstream/master
```

#### Changelog for this skeleton

Note that `CHANGELOG.md` is just a template for this skeleton.
The actual changes for this project are documented in the commit history
and summarized under [Releases].

[Releases]: https://github.com/meltwater/makenew-node-lib/releases

## Installation

Add this as a dependency to your project using [Yarn] with

```
$ yarn add @meltwater/makenew-node-lib
```

[Yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com/

## Usage

**See the complete [API documentation](./docs) and [working examples](./examples).**

This package provides an async function which checks if its argument is true.

```js
import isTrue from '@meltwater/makenew-node-lib'

const logTrue = async () => {
  const trueValue = await isTrue(true)
  console.log(trueValue)
}

logTrue().catch(err => { console.log(err) })
// true
```

## Development Quickstart

```
$ git clone https://github.com/meltwater/makenew-node-lib.git
$ cd makenew-node-lib
$ nvm install
$ yarn
```

Run each command below in a separate terminal window:

```
$ yarn run watch
$ yarn run watch:test
```

## Development and Testing

### Source code

The [makenew-node-lib source] is hosted on GitHub.
Clone the project with

```
$ git clone git@github.com:meltwater/makenew-node-lib.git
```

[makenew-node-lib source]: https://github.com/meltwater/makenew-node-lib

### Requirements

You will need [Node.js] with [Yarn]
and a [Node.js debugging] client.

Be sure that all commands run under the correct Node version, e.g.,
if using [nvm], install the correct version with

```
$ nvm install
```

Set the active version for each shell session with

```
$ nvm use
```

Install the development dependencies with

```
$ yarn
```

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[Node.js debugging]: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/

[nvm]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm

#### CircleCI

_CircleCI should already be configured: this section is for reference only._

The following environment variables must be set on [CircleCI]:

- `NPM_TOKEN`: npm token for installing and publishing private packages.
- `CODECOV_TOKEN`: Codecov token for uploading coverage reports (optional).

These may be set manually or by running the script `./circleci/envvars.sh`.

[CircleCI]: https://circleci.com/

### Development tasks

Primary development tasks are defined under `scripts` in `package.json`
and available via `yarn run`.
View them with

```
$ yarn run
```

#### Production build

Lint, test, and transpile the production build to `dist` with

```
$ yarn run dist
```

##### Publishing a new release

_Update the CHANGELOG before each new release._

Release a new version using [`npm version`][npm version].
This will run all tests, update the version number,
create and push a tagged commit,
and trigger CircleCI to publish the new version to npm.

[npm version]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version

#### Examples

**See the [full documentation on using examples](./examples).**

View all examples with

```
$ yarn run example
```

#### Linting

Linting against the [JavaScript Standard Style] and [JSON Lint]
is handled by [gulp].

View available commands with

```
$ yarn run gulp -- --tasks
```

In a separate window, use gulp to watch for changes
and lint JavaScript and JSON files with

```
$ yarn run watch
```

Automatically fix most JavaScript formatting errors with

```
$ yarn run format
```

[gulp]: http://gulpjs.com/
[JavaScript Standard Style]: http://standardjs.com/
[JSON Lint]: https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint

#### Tests

Unit and integration testing is handled by [AVA]
and coverage is reported by [Istanbul] and uploaded to [Codecov].

- Test files end in `.spec.js`.
- Unit tests are placed under `lib` alongside the tested module.
- Integration tests are placed in `test`.
- Static files used in tests are placed in `fixtures`.

Watch and run tests on changes with

```
$ yarn run watch:test
```

Generate a coverage report with

```
$ yarn run report
```

An HTML version will be saved in `coverage`.

##### Debugging tests

Create a breakpoint by adding the statement `debugger` to the test
and start a debug session with, e.g.,

```
$ yarn run ava:inspect lib/true.spec.js
```

Watch and restart the debugging session on changes with

```
$ yarn run ava:inspect:watch lib/true.spec.js
```
